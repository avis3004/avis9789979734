            <h2><a name="thai">TamilNadu Village Habitation Improvement Scheme (THAI)</a></h2>
			<p align="justify">
			This Government has introduced the flagship programme called Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme from 2011-12 onwards to overcome 
			the bottlenecks in the uneven distribution of resources and to provide minimum basic infrastructure facilities to all the habitations. <b>Tamil Nadu is the 
			only State focusing on Habitation as the unit of development and no other State in the Country is implementing such an innovative scheme.</b></p>
			<p align="justify">
			There are about 7 habitations on an average for each Village Panchayat in Tamil Nadu with 79,394 habitations in 12,524 Village Panchayats. However, the number of 			            habitations varies from District to district. The average number of habitations in a Village Panchayat in The Nilgiris District is 37 whereas it is only 3 in Villupuram            District. Therefore, allocation of equal amount to all the Village Panchayats, with varied number of habitations, has led to disparity in development, disproportionate            distribution of assets and uneven progress. The THAI scheme has come as boon with the aim of extending the basic facilities to the grass root habitation.</p>
			<p align="justify">
			There are 12,524 Village Panchayats in the State spread across the 31 Districts (except Chennai). As can be seen from the following table, the population of Village            Panchayats in Tamil Nadu varies widely with some Village Panchayats having population even below 500 while some others have population exceeding 10,000.</p>

<p align="justify">The requirement of a Village Panchayat will be more if it has more number of habitations.  Taking this concept into consideration, the Village Panchayats have been grouped into 4 categories based on the number of habitations for the purpose of allocation of funds.  Thus, Village Panchayats with more number of habitations and having a larger population shall receive more funds.  The above table clearly depicts the fund requirement for all the 12,524 Village Panchayats. Thus the habitations in all the Village Panchayats in Tamil Nadu would be covered at a total cost of Rs.3,400 crores under the THAI scheme. In 2011-12, the scheme has been implemented with an annual allocation of Rs.680 crore. Considering the importance of filling up the infrastructural gaps of rural habitations, the Government has allocated Rs. 750  crore during 2012-13.</p>

  <h2><a name="women">Renovation of Integrated Sanitary Complex for Women</a></h2>
 <p> Provision of sanitary facilities for women was one of the priority areas of the Rural Development Department when this Government was in power in 2001.  The non availability of sanitary facilities impacts women and they suffer in silence.  Absence of sanitary facilities is primarily due to both poverty and cultural inhibitions, which had to be overcome.  Therefore, it was of paramount importance to ensure privacy and safety to women besides improving general hygiene and health to the rural people.</p>
           <p> The Government in 2001 decided to build Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women in all the 12,618 Village Panchayats in the State, at an approximate area of 750 sq.ft. each. The selected sites were easily accessible to the rural women and nearer to the habitations.  Each complex had 14 water closets, 2 bathrooms, 1 pump room with pump set, 1 water tub and stone-paved washing facilities.  Adequate water supply for washing and bathing requirements were also ensured.  The total users were identified and grouped for the purpose of allocation of individual toilets within the complex.  The Village Panchayats provided electricity connection for water supply and lighting and the allotted families maintained the upkeep of the complex.  The complexes were provided with incinerators for disposal of the sanitary napkins of the user women.</p>
           <p> Initially, 385 Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were constructed at the rate of 1 per Panchayat Union at a cost of 
Rs.2.00 lakh each.  Between 2001 and 2004, all the Village Panchayats in the State were covered under the Scheme with the enhanced unit cost of Rs. 2.25 lakh.  However, most of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were rendered unusable since the previous Government did not give adequate attention for its maintenance.</p>
           <p> <b>As per the directions of the Hon&#146ble Chief Minister, 12,796 sanitary complexes which were in the state of disuse have been renovated at a cost of Rs.170 crore during 2011-12, thereby restoring the basic facilities of the rural women.</b></p>
<p><b>9.1 Maintenance of Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women</b></p>
 <p><b>Formation of User Groups</b></p>
             <p>In order to ensure regular maintenance and usage of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women, User Groups have been formed for all the renovated Complexes from among the women Self Help Group members and Habitation Level Forums, with the assistance of the Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women.  These User Groups have also been trained on the use and maintenance of Complexes.  A Booklet on use and maintenance of Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women has been prepared and given to all the User Groups as a Ready Reckoner.</p>
<p><b> Direct maintenance</b></p>
            <p>The Village Panchayats shall ensure the availability of electricity connection in the Complex.  The current consumption charges in respect of water supply and lighting is met out of the Village Panchayat General Fund.  In order to ensure continuous functioning of the Complex, any minor repair/maintenance work like maintenance of pump sets and cleaning of septic tanks are being attended to by the Village Panchayat and the expenditure is met out from the Village Panchayat General Fund.</p>
            <p> User Groups follow up with the Village Panchayats so that the current consumption charges are regularly paid, septic tanks are cleaned at periodic intervals and minor repairs are attended to then and there, by the Village Panchayat concerned.</p>
 <p><b>Day to day Maintenance through User Groups</b></p>
            <p> The day to day maintenance of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women is undertaken by the User Groups through a nominal contribution given by the user members.  The User Groups have so far collected Rs.3.17 crore from among the members for maintenance of the Complexes.  This kind of a shift in the maintenance of Complexes through the User Group has created a perception of ownership among them and facilitated sustainability of the Complexes.</p>
 <p><b>Constitution of Monitoring Committees</b></p>
         <p>  To monitor the maintenance of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women, the District Collectors have constituted the District Level and Block Level Monitoring Committees.  The above Committees deliberate on the following and take necessary follow up action:</p>
		 <ul>
<li>Functioning status of each and every Integrated Sanitary Complex for Women</li>
<li>Maintenance of the Complexes by User Groups</li>
<li>Periodic maintenance by Village Panchayats</li>
<li>Feedback given by the User Groups</li>
<li>Feedback on inspections made by the members of the Committee / Zonal Officers.</li>
</ul>

  <h2><a name="clean">Clean Village Campaign</a></h2>

          <p>The strategy is focused on mobilizing the community through intensive Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities with the involvement of Village Panchayats and various other departments. </p>

The Government disbursed awards every year to 15 such Village Panchayats as a &#148Cash and Recognition Incentive&#148.</p>
        <p>  Clean Village Campaign which was shelved by the previous Government was revived and re-introduced by this Government during 2011-12 with an allocation of Rs.1.55 crore for giving cash award of Rs.5 lakh for 31 selected Village Panchayats, at the rate of one Village Panchayat from each district.</p>
         <p> For the year 2011-12, proposals were received from all the 31 District Collectors who have recommended 91 Village Panchayats for the Award. These proposals have been scrutinized and 31 Village Panchayats, one Village Panchayat from each district, have been selected for the Award by the Government.  Similar exercise is being carried out for 2012-13 also.</p>
