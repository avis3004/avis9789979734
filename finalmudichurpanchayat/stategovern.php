            <h2><a name="thai">TamilNadu Village Habitation Improvement Scheme (THAI)</a></h2>
			<p align="justify">
			This Government has introduced the flagship programme called Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme from 2011-12 onwards to overcome 
			the bottlenecks in the uneven distribution of resources and to provide minimum basic infrastructure facilities to all the habitations. <b>Tamil Nadu is the 
			only State focusing on Habitation as the unit of development and no other State in the Country is implementing such an innovative scheme.</b></p>
			<p align="justify">
			There are about 7 habitations on an average for each Village Panchayat in Tamil Nadu with 79,394 habitations in 12,524 Village Panchayats. However, the number of 			            habitations varies from District to district. The average number of habitations in a Village Panchayat in The Nilgiris District is 37 whereas it is only 3 in Villupuram            District. Therefore, allocation of equal amount to all the Village Panchayats, with varied number of habitations, has led to disparity in development, disproportionate            distribution of assets and uneven progress. The THAI scheme has come as boon with the aim of extending the basic facilities to the grass root habitation.</p>
			<p align="justify">
			There are 12,524 Village Panchayats in the State spread across the 31 Districts (except Chennai). As can be seen from the following table, the population of Village            Panchayats in Tamil Nadu varies widely with some Village Panchayats having population even below 500 while some others have population exceeding 10,000.</p>

<p align="justify">The requirement of a Village Panchayat will be more if it has more number of habitations.  Taking this concept into consideration, the Village Panchayats have been grouped into 4 categories based on the number of habitations for the purpose of allocation of funds.  Thus, Village Panchayats with more number of habitations and having a larger population shall receive more funds.  The above table clearly depicts the fund requirement for all the 12,524 Village Panchayats. Thus the habitations in all the Village Panchayats in Tamil Nadu would be covered at a total cost of Rs.3,400 crores under the THAI scheme. In 2011-12, the scheme has been implemented with an annual allocation of Rs.680 crore. Considering the importance of filling up the infrastructural gaps of rural habitations, the Government has allocated Rs. 750  crore during 2012-13.</p>
