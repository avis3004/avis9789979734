                    In the Panchayat there were 16 OHTs and 18 hand pumps and 11 mini power pumps and
                    486 street taps. As per the plan of the Government 55 liters of purified drinking
                    water is provided per head.  Apart from this, drinking water with a capacity of 2o
                    liters purified drinking water is provided at the cost of Rs. 15/- through the Panchayat.
                    Due to the purchase of this drinking water every house in the village is saving about 
                    Rs. 450/- per month.
