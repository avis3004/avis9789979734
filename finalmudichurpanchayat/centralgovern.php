            <h2><a name="mgnregs">Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)</a></h2>
			<p align="justify">
			 The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) was conceptualized and enacted as an Act in the Parliament in September 2005 to give a statutory backing to the scheme. The objective of the Act is to enhance the livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The primary objective of the Scheme is to augment the wage employment and the auxiliary objective is to strengthen natural resource management through works that address causes of chronic poverty like drought, deforestation, soil erosion, etc., and thus encourage sustainable development.</b></p>
			<p align="justify">
			          In Tamil Nadu, the Scheme was first notified on 2.2.2006 in 6 districts of the State, which was subsequently extended to other districts in a phased manner.</p>
